      Hello! My name is Akansha Lalwani. I'm a Data Science enthusiast with strong mathematical and communication skills having an interest in data analysis to inform business decisions and bring about a change in the world.

      The spark for programming in me ignited the first time a professor taught me how to use my understanding of matrix algebra to populate and loop through a vector. It was stoked every time I learned a new language (Python, R, SQL, MATLAB) and molded the code for projects in machine learning, NLP, or geospatial data visualization, to name a few. Every time I jumped from my seat, ecstatic that a null hypothesis could be rejected or my confusion matrix had a particularly low false-positive rate, my immense passion for programming and data science was stoked further.

      My qualitative skills include written and oral communication, leadership experience, creative problem-solving, and team management. Thanks for reading about me today!
